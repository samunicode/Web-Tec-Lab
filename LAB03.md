# Usage of Inline, Internal, and External Style Sheets using CSS

## Inline Style Sheets

Inline style sheets are applied directly to the HTML elements using the "style" attribute. This style sheet is specific to the element it is applied to and takes precedence over other style sheets. Here's an example:

<p style="color: red; font-size: 18px;">This is a paragraph with inline styles applied to it.</p>
```
